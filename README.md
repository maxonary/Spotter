## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher.
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based).
- Node.js and npm (optional, for advanced development).

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meme-map.git
   cd meme-map
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Secrets:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_connection_string>
     ```
   - For Streamlit, configure `secrets.toml` in the `.streamlit` folder:
     ```toml
     [default]
     MONGO_URI = "<your_mongo_connection_string>"
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn api_meme_map:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```
   - Start the Streamlit frontend:
     ```bash
     streamlit run meme_map.py
     ```

## Deployment

### Hosting FastAPI
- Use platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku** for hosting the FastAPI backend.
- Example `Procfile` for Heroku:
  ```
  web: uvicorn api_meme_map:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```

### Hosting Streamlit
- Use **Streamlit Cloud** for deploying the frontend.
- Push your code to GitHub and link the repository to Streamlit Cloud.
